SQL Tutorial -
- SQL is a standard language for =>  storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
- Our SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.

---------------------------------------------------

Introduction to SQL -
- SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

What is SQL?
- Structured Query Language
- SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
- SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987

What Can SQL do?
SQL can execute queries against a database
SQL can retrieve data from a database
SQL can insert records in a database
SQL can update records in a database
SQL can delete records from a database
SQL can create new databases
SQL can create new tables in a database
SQL can create stored procedures in a database
SQL can create views in a database
SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

SQL is a Standard - BUT....
- Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.
- However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

Using SQL in Web Site
To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:
- An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
- To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
- To use SQL to get the data you want
- To use HTML / CSS to style the page

RDBMS - 
- Relational Database Management System.
- RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
- The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

SQL Syntax - 

SQL Statements
- Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.
- SQL statements consist of keywords that are easy to understand.
- SQL statement returns all records from a table named "Customers":

E.g. - Select all record from the Customers table:
SELECT * FROM Customers;

* NOTE:-
Keep in Mind That...
- SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
- In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.


Semicolon after SQL Statements?
- Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
- Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
- SELECT - extracts data from a database
- UPDATE - updates data in a database
- DELETE - deletes data from a database
- INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
- CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
- ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
- CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
- ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
- DROP TABLE - deletes a table
- CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
- DROP INDEX - deletes an index

------------------------------------------------------------

SQL SELECT Statement -

The SQL SELECT Statement -
- The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
E.g. - Return data from the Customers table:
SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;

Syntax - 
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;


Select ALL columns - 
- If you want to return all columns, without specifying every column name, you can use the SELECT * syntax:
E.g. - Return all the columns from the Customers table:
SELECT * FROM Customers;
